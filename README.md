# Diabetic Prediction using SVM Classifier

**Overview:**
This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The prediction is based on various features including Pregnancies, Glucose level, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin level, BMI (Body Mass Index), Diabetes Pedigree Function, and Age.

**Dataset:**
The dataset used for training and testing the SVM classifier contains information on individuals' medical attributes such as pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age. It is crucial to ensure the dataset is appropriately preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and normalization for optimal performance.

**SVM Classifier:**
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It works by finding the optimal hyperplane that best separates different classes in the feature space. In this project, SVM is utilized for binary classification to predict whether an individual has diabetes or not based on their medical features.

**Features:**
Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration
Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure
Skin Thickness: Triceps skin fold thickness
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin
BMI: Body Mass Index
Diabetes Pedigree Function: Diabetes pedigree function
Age: Age in years

**Description:**
This project implements a diabetic prediction system using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. By analyzing various medical attributes including pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, and others, the system predicts the likelihood of an individual having diabetes. The SVM classifier is trained on a carefully curated dataset, ensuring preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and normalization are performed. The project provides a comprehensive solution for diabetic prediction, which can be utilized in healthcare settings for early diagnosis and intervention. Further improvements could involve exploring additional features or fine-tuning the SVM model parameters for enhanced prediction accuracy.
